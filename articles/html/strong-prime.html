<p>In <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399875">mathematics</span>, a <b>strong prime</b> is a <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399876">prime number</span> with certain special properties. The definitions of strong primes are different in <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399877">cryptography</span> and <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399878">number theory</span>.

<p>In <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399878">number theory</span>, a <b>strong prime</b> is a prime number that is greater than the <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399879">arithmetic mean</span> of the nearest prime above and below (in other words, it's closer to the following than to the preceding prime). Or to put it algebraically, given a prime number <i>p<sub>n</sub></i>, where <i>n</i> is its index in the ordered set of prime numbers, <span class="texhtml"><i>p<sub>n</sub></i> > <span class="sfrac nowrap" style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:-0.5em; font-size:85%; text-align:center;"><span style="display:block; line-height:1em; margin:0 0.1em;"><i>p</i><sub><i>n</i> − 1</sub> + <i>p</i><sub><i>n</i> + 1</sub></span><span class="visualhide">/</span><span style="display:block; line-height:1em; margin:0 0.1em; border-top:1px solid;">2</span></span></span>. For example, 17 is the seventh prime: the sixth and eighth primes, 13 and 19, add up to 32, and half that is 16; 17 is greater than 16, and so 17 is a strong prime.

<p>In a <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399906">twin prime</span> pair (<i>p</i>, <i>p</i> + 2) with <i>p</i> > 5, <i>p</i> is always a strong prime, since 3 must divide <i>p</i> − 2, which cannot be prime.
</p><p>It is possible for a prime to be a strong prime both in the cryptographic sense and the number theoretic sense. For the sake of illustration, 439351292910452432574786963588089477522344331 is a strong prime in the number theoretic sense because the arithmetic mean of its two neighboring primes is 62 less. Without the aid of a computer, this number would be a strong prime in the cryptographic sense because 439351292910452432574786963588089477522344330 has the large prime factor 1747822896920092227343 (and in turn the number one less than that has the large prime factor 1683837087591611009), 439351292910452432574786963588089477522344332 has the large prime factor 864608136454559457049 (and in turn the number one less than that has the large prime factor 105646155480762397). Even using algorithms more advanced than <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399907">trial division</span>, these numbers would be difficult to factor by hand. For a modern <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399908">computer algebra system</span>, these numbers can be factored almost instantaneously. A cryptographically strong prime has to be much larger than this example.

<h2>Definition in cryptography</h2>
<p>In <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399877">cryptography</span>, a prime number <i>p</i> is said to be "strong" if the following conditions are satisfied.
</p>
<ul><li><i>p</i> is sufficiently large to be useful in cryptography; typically this requires <i>p</i> to be too large for plausible computational resources to enable a cryptanalyst to factorise products of <i>p</i> with other strong primes.</li>
<li><i>p</i> − 1 has large prime factors. That is, <i>p</i> = <i>a</i><sub>1</sub><i>q</i><sub>1</sub> + 1 for some integer <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> and large prime <i>q</i><sub>1</sub>.</li>
<li><i>q</i><sub>1</sub> − 1 has large prime factors. That is, <i>q</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>a</i><sub>2</sub><i>q</i><sub>2</sub> + 1 for some integer <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> and large prime <i>q</i><sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li><i>p</i> + 1 has large prime factors. That is, <i>p</i> = <i>a</i><sub>3</sub><i>q</i><sub>3</sub> − 1 for some integer <i>a</i><sub>3</sub> and large prime <i>q</i><sub>3</sub>.</li></ul>
<h2>Application of strong primes in cryptography</h2>
<h3>Factoring-based cryptosystems</h3>
<p>Some people suggest that in the <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399909">key generation</span> process in <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399910">RSA</span> cryptosystems, the modulus <i>n</i> should be chosen as the product of two strong primes. This makes the factorization of <i>n</i> = <i>pq</i> using Pollard's <i>p</i> − 1 algorithm computationally infeasible.  For this reason, strong primes are required by the ANSI X9.31 standard for use in generating RSA keys for <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399911">digital signatures</span>.  However, strong primes do not protect against modulus factorisation using newer algorithms such as <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399912">Lenstra elliptic curve factorization</span> and Number Field Sieve algorithm. Given the additional cost of generating strong primes <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399913">RSA Security</span> do not currently recommend their use in <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399909">key generation</span>. Similar (and more technical) argument is also given by Rivest and Silverman.
</p>
<h3>Discrete-logarithm-based cryptosystems</h3>
<p>It is shown by Stephen Pohlig and <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399916">Martin Hellman</span> in 1978 that if all the factors of <i>p</i> − 1 are less than log<sup><i>c</i></sup> <i>p</i>, then the problem of solving <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399918">discrete logarithm</span> modulo <i>p</i> is in P. Therefore, for cryptosystems based on discrete logarithm, such as <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399920">DSA</span>, it is required that <i>p</i> − 1 have at least one large prime factor.
</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous facts</h2>
<p>A computationally large <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399924">safe prime</span> is likely to be a cryptographically strong prime.
</p><p>Note that the criteria for determining if a pseudoprime is a <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399926">strong pseudoprime</span> is by congruences to powers of a base, not by inequality to the arithmetic mean of neighboring pseudoprimes.
</p><p>When a prime is equal to the mean of its neighboring primes, it's called a <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399928">balanced prime</span>. When it's less, it's called a <b>weak prime</b> (not to be confused with a <span class="hyperlink-click" data-id="210399930">weakly prime number</span>).
